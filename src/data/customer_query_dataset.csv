But I just realized I entered the wrong shipping address. Can you change it?,"I'm glad the email came through! Let me check your order status - it's currently being prepared for shipment but hasn't been handed to the carrier yet. Yes, we can update the address! Please provide the correct complete shipping address including zip code. I'll update it in the next 5 minutes to ensure it ships to the right location. Quick action is important here!"

Order or Payment Issues,My coupon code isn't working at checkout.,"We're sorry you're experiencing this issue! Could you please share the coupon code you're trying to use?

Once you share the code, we'll check its status and either help you apply it or provide an alternative solution. We want to make sure you get your discount!",The code is SAVE20 and my cart total is $85.,"Thank you! I checked and SAVE20 requires a minimum purchase of $100. Your cart is currently at $85, so you're $15 away from using this code. You have a few options: 1) Add $15 more to your cart to use SAVE20 (saving $20), or 2) I can give you code SAVE15 which works on your current cart (saving $12.75). Which would you prefer?",What if I add a $15 item? Would I save more overall?,"Great thinking! Let's do the math: Your current cart ($85) + $15 item = $100. With SAVE20, you'd save $20, bringing your total to $80. So you'd pay $80 and get $100 worth of products - that's definitely the better deal! You'd essentially get a $15 item for free and save $5 overall. Would you like some recommendations for items around $15 to add to your cart?"

Product Usage Help,Should I apply the serum before or after moisturizer?,"Great question! Serums should always be applied before moisturizer.

This layering technique ensures maximum absorption and effectiveness. Let us know if you need help building a complete routine!",,,,
Product Usage Help,Can I use this face mask daily?,"Thank you for asking! It depends on the mask type.

We can provide specific usage instructions based on the product. Proper usage ensures the best results!",,,,
Product Usage Help,Can I combine this vitamin C serum with retinol?,"Excellent question! We generally recommend using vitamin C in the morning and retinol at night, as using them together can cause irritation. Vitamin C provides antioxidant protection during the day, while retinol works on cell turnover overnight. If you want to use both in your routine, this morning/evening split is the safest approach. Let us know if you need a complete routine guide!",,,,
Product Usage Help,How long will one bottle of serum last?,Great question! One 30ml bottle typically lasts 2-3 months with regular daily use. You only need 2-3 drops per application—a little goes a long way! Apply it to your face and neck every morning and/or evening after cleansing. Proper usage not only makes it last longer but also ensures optimal results. Let us know if you need any other product information!,,,,
